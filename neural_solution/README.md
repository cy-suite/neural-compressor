# What's Neural Solution?

Neural Solution is a flexible and easy to use tool that brings the capabilities of IntelÂ® Neural Compressor as a service. Users can effortlessly submit optimization tasks through the RESTful/gRPC APIs. Neural Solution automatically dispatches these tasks to one or multiple nodes, streamlining the entire process.

# Why Neural Solution?

- Efficiency: Neural Solution accelerates the optimization process by seamlessly parallelizing the tuning across multiple nodes.
- APIs: REST and gRPC are supported for submitting optimization tasks.
- Code Less: When working with Hugging Face models, Neural Solution drives the optimization process without requiring any code modifications by integrating the Neural Coder's functionality.
