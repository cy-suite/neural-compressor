# What's Neural Solution?
<!-- TODO what is ns -->
Neural Solution is a flexible and easy to use tool that brings the capabilities of INC as a service. Users can effortlessly submit optimization tasks through the HTTP/gRPC API. Neural Solution automatically dispatches these tasks to one or multiple nodes, streamlining the entire process.

# Why Neural Solution?
<!-- TODO what does the ns provide -->
- Efficient: Neural Solution speed up the optimization process by seamlessly parallelizes the tuning process across multi nodes.
- Security: REST and gRPC supported for optimization submission.
- Code Less: For hugging Face models, Neural Solution drive the optimization process without code modification by integrate the functionality of Neural Coder.
