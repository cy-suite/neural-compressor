# What's Neural Solution?
<!-- TODO what is ns -->
Neural Solution is a flexible and easy to use tool that brings the capabilities of INC as a service. Users can effortlessly submit optimization tasks through the HTTP/gRPC API. Neural Solution automatically dispatches these tasks to one or multiple nodes, streamlining the entire process.

# Why Neural Solution?
<!-- TODO what does the ns provide -->
- Efficiency: Neural Solution accelerates the optimization process by seamlessly parallelizing the tuning across multiple nodes.
- APIs: REST and gRPC are supported for submitting optimization tasks.
- Code Less: When working with Hugging Face models, Neural Solution drives the optimization process without requiring any code modifications by integrating the Neural Coder's functionality.
