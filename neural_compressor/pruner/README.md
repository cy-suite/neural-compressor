## Introduction



### Neural Network Pruning
Neural network pruning is a promising model compression technique that removes the least important parameters/neurons in the network and achieves compact architectures with minimal accuracy drop and maximal inference acceleration. As state-of-the-art model sizes have grown at an unprecedented speed, pruning has become increasingly crucial for reducing the computational and memory footprint that huge neural networks require.

### Pruning Patterns



Pruning patterns defines the rules of pruned weights' arrangements in space. INC currently supports unstructured, N:M and NxM patterns. Please note that N:M pattern is applied to input channels while NxM pattern is applied to output ones. [Details](../../docs/source/pruning_details.md#pruning-patterns).

### Pruning Criteria



Pruning Criteria determines how should the weights of a neural network be scored and pruned. In the image below, pruning scores are represented by neurons' color and those with the lowest scores are pruned. The magnitude and gradient are widely used to score the weights. Currently, INC supports **magnitude**, **gradient**, **snip** and **snip_momentum** criteria; pruning criteria is defined along with pruning type in INC configurations. [Details](../../docs/source/pruning_details.md#pruning-criteria).

### Pruning Schedules



Pruning schedule defines the way the model reach the target sparsity (the ratio of pruned weights). Both **one-shot** and **iterative** pruning schedules are supported. [Details](../../docs/source/pruning_details.md#pruning-schedule).

</div>


### Pruning Types



Pruning type defines how the masks are generated and applied to a neural network. Both **pattern_lock** and **progressive** types are supported by INC. [Details](../../docs/source/pruning_details.md#pruning-type).



### Regularization



Regularization is a technique that discourages learning a more complex model and therefore performs variable-selection. In the image below, some weights are pushed to be as small as possible and the connections are thus sparsified. **Group-lasso** method is used in INC. 
[Details](../../docs/source/pruning_details.md#regularization).

## Get Started with Pruning API



Neural Compressor `Pruning` API is defined under `neural_compressor.pruning`, which takes a user-defined config object as input. 
Users can pass the customized training/evaluation functions to `Pruning` in various scenarios. 



The following section exemplifies how to use hooks in user pass-in training function to perform model pruning. Through the pruning API, multiple pruner objects are supported in one single Pruning object to enable layer-specific configurations and a default setting is used as a complement.

```python
from neural_compressor.pruner.pruning import Pruning
from neural_compressor.config import WeightPruningConfig

config = WeightPruningConfig(
    pruning_configs,  # An example of pruning_configs is shown below.
    target_sparsity=0.8, start_step=1, end_step=10, pruning_frequency=1  # Default pruning setting.
)
prune = Pruning(config)  # Pruning constructor.
prune.model = model  # Set model object to prune.
prune.on_train_begin()  # Execute on_train_begin hook before training.
for epoch in range(num_train_epochs):
    model.train()
    prune.on_epoch_begin(epoch)  # Execute on_epoch_begin hook before each epoch.
    for step, batch in enumerate(train_dataloader):
            prune.on_step_begin(step)  # Execute on_step_begin hook before each step.
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        prune.on_before_optimizer_step()  # Execute on_before_optimizer_step() hook before optimization.
        optimizer.step()
prune.on_after_optimizer_step()  # Execute on_after_optimizer_step() hook after optimization.
        scheduler.step()   # Update learning rate schedule
        model.zero_grad()
        prune.on_step_end()  # Execute on_step_end hook after each step.
prune.on_epoch_end()  # Execute on_epoch_end hook after each epoch.
...
```

```python
pruning_configs = [
        {
            'target_sparsity': 0.9,   # Target sparsity ratio of modules.
            'pruning_type': "snip_momentum", # Default pruning type.
            'pattern': "4x1", # Default pruning pattern. 
            'op_names': ['layer1.*'],  # A list of modules that would be pruned.
            'excluded_op_names': ['layer3.*'],  # A list of modules that would not be pruned.
            'start_step': 0,  # Step at which to begin pruning.
            'end_step': 10,   # Step at which to end pruning.
            'pruning_scope': "global", # Default pruning scope.
            'pruning_frequency': 1, # Frequency of applying pruning.
            'min_sparsity_ratio_per_op': 0.0,  # Minimum sparsity ratio of each module.
            'max_sparsity_ratio_per_op': 0.98, # Maximum sparsity ratio of each module.
            'sparsity_decay_type': "exp", # Function applied to control pruning rate.
            'pruning_op_types': ['Conv', 'Linear'], # Types of op that would be pruned.
        },
        {
            "op_names": ['layer3.*'], # A list of modules that would be pruned.
            "pruning_type": "snip_momentum_progressive",   # Pruning type for the listed ops.
            # 'target_sparsity' 
        } # For layer3, the missing target_sparsity would be complemented by default setting (i.e. 0.8)
    ]
```

 In the case mentioned above, pruning process can be done by pre-defined hooks in Neural Compressor. Users need to place those hooks inside the training function. The pre-defined Neural Compressor hooks are listed below.



```
on_train_begin() : Execute at the beginning of training phase.
on_epoch_begin(epoch) : Execute at the beginning of each epoch.
on_step_begin(batch) : Execute at the beginning of each batch.
on_step_end() : Execute at the end of each batch.
on_epoch_end() : Execute at the end of each epoch.
on_before_optimizer_step() : Execute before optimization step.
on_after_optimizer_step() : Execute after optimization step.
```






## Examples



We validate the pruning technique on typical models across various domains (including CV and NLP) and the examples are listed in [Pruning Examples](../../docs/source/pruning_details.md#examples). A complete overview of validated examples including quantization, pruning and distillation results could be found in  [INC Validated examples](../../docs/source/validated_model_list.md#validated-pruning-examples).


Please refer to pruning examples([PyTorch](../../examples/README.md#Pruning-1)) for more information.
