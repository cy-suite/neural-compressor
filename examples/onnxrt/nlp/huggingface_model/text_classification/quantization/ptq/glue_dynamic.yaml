model:                                               # mandatory. used to specify model specific information.
  name: text_classification 
  framework: onnxrt_integerops                       # mandatory. possible values are tensorflow, mxnet, pytorch, pytorch_ipex, onnxrt_integerops and onnxrt_qlinearops.

evaluation:                                          # optional. required if user doesn't provide eval_func in neural_compressor.Quantization.
  performance:                                       # optional. used to benchmark performance of passing model.
    warmup: 10
    iteration: 100
    configs:
      cores_per_instance: 28
      num_of_instance: 1

quantization:
  approach: post_training_dynamic_quant              # optional. default value is post_training_static_quant.                                                   
  
tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
